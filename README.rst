python-co2sys
=============

This project is an effort to bring the CO2SYS software to the
scientific community that uses python as their main programing language.

CO2SYS calculates the two carbonate system parameters given any other
two of the four measurable carbonate system parameters (together with the
inorganic carbon speciation and the saturation of calcite and aragonite).  In
addition to the calculated results, the software reports the sensitivity of
the calculated parameters to uncertainties in input parameters, constants,
and etc.
